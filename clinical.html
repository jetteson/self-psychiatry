	<h1>Clinical Recovery</h1>
	<p>Clinical recovery is about reducing the symptoms of depression, especially if those symptoms impair your ability to function. It is  one part of recovery, but not the whole picture. Pursuing clinical recovery helps to reduce very dangerous or life-limiting complications of depression.</p>

	<h2>Develop a better understanding of your illness</h2>
	<p>	There are four major symptom domains of depression. Someone with depression may experience one or more of these and in varying degrees. The domains are: <b>mood, cognition, vegetative symptoms</b> and <b>psychomotor impairment</b>.</p>
</section>

<div class="tertiary-blob-container">
<section class="tertiary-blob text-list">
		<h3>Mood Disturbances</h3>
		Perhaps the most expected disturbance, depression can alter mood such that one experiences one or more of the following:
		<ul>
			<li>emotional pain</li>
			<li>hypersensitivity to unpleasant events (eg. negative reaction or feelings out of proportion to the magnitude of a negative event)</li>
			<li>insensitivity to unpleasant events (eg. being 'numb' to things that normally would evoke a negative reaction in you)</li>
			<li>reduced ability to feel pleasure, look forward to things, or enjoy things like food/entertainment/socializing</li>
			<li>reduced range of emotions (ie. you are not experiencing a rich array of emotions, but rather you feel 'one-note')</li>
			<li>apathy</li>
		</ul>
		These are symptoms a practioner may be trying to investigate when asking you about your <b>mood</b> or <b>loss of interest in things you used to enjoy</b>.
	</section>
	 <svg class="mobile-divider" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 10" fill="none" stroke="#BF00FF" stroke-width="1">
        <path d="M2,5 C20,0 40,10 60,5 S100,0 100,5" />
    </svg>
	<section class="tertiary-blob text-list">
		<h3>Cognition</h3>
		Not only can depression affect how you feel, but also how you think. The core feature of cognition in depression is an extremely negative outlook on things: namely, the self, the world, and the future -- this is known as the negative triad. 
		<ul>
			<li>ideas of deprivation and loss</li>
			<li>low self-esteem and self-confidence</li>
			<li>self-reproach and pathological guilt</li>
			<li>helplessness, hopelessness, and pessimism</li>
			<li>recurrent thoughts of death and suicide</li>
		</ul>
		The effects of depression on the mind can be so severe that <b>delusions</b> occur, especially ones deriving from the four basic human insecurities: health, financial status, moral worth, and relationship to others. 
		<blockquote>For example, financial delusions may look like someone incorrectly believing they mismanaged their finances in a way that their children will soon starve beacause of. Delusions of ill health could be beliefs that one has an occult illness such as cancer or acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)<sup><a href="references.html">*</a></sup></blockquote>
		Severe depression can also include frank <b>psychosis</b>, such as hallucinations or delusions that are bizarre rather than just out of proportion pesisism/catatstrophization.

    </svg>

	<section class="tertiary-blob text-list">
		<h3>Vegetative Symptoms</h3>
		Vegetative symptoms refer to physical changes that often accompany depression, affecting basic bodily functions. These symptoms can be related to disruptions in the body's natural rhythms and can significantly impact daily life. 
		<ul>
		    <li>Anorexia (loss of appetite)</li>
		    <li>Weight loss or weight gain</li>
		    <li>Insomnia (difficulty sleeping)</li>
		    <li>Hypersomnia (excessive sleeping)</li>
		    <li>Circadian dysregulation (disruption of the body's natural sleep-wake cycle)</li>
		    <li>Seasonal changes in mood (depression that worsens in specific seasons, especially autumn and winter)</li>
		    <li>Sexual dysfunction (reduced interest or ability in sexual activity)</li>
		</ul>

    </svg>

	<section class="tertiary-blob text-list">
	<h3>Psychomotor Impairment in Depression</h3>
		Psychomotor impairment in depression refers to disruptions in a personâ€™s ability to move and think, ranging from restlessness to extreme slowing. These changes are linked to brain function disturbances in areas that regulate movement and coordination.

		

		<h4>1. Agitation:</h4>
		<p>Agitation involves heightened physical or mental restlessness. While it's easier to observe, it often coexists with psychomotor slowing.</p>
		<ul>
		    <li>Restlessness</li>
		    <li>Pressured speech</li>
		    <li>Hand wringing, hair pulling</li>
		    <li>Rapid thoughts and actions</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>2. Impairment (Slowing):</h4>
		<p>This refers to the noticeable slowing of both mental and physical activities, making it hard to engage in daily tasks.</p>
		<ul>
		    <li>Difficulty initiating physical or mental activity</li>
		    <li>Few spontaneous movements</li>
		    <li>Slumped posture, downcast gaze</li>
		    <li>Fatigue (everything feels like an effort)</li>
		    <li>Slowed speech and response time</li>
		    <li>Feeling like time has slowed or stopped</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>3. Pseudo-Dementia:</h4>
		<p>In older adults, psychomotor slowing can become so severe that it mimics dementia, causing cognitive difficulties.</p>
		<ul>
		    <li>Severe slowing of mental functions</li>
		    <li>Memory issues, disorientation, confusion</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>4. Stupor:</h4>
		<p>In extreme cases, psychomotor slowing can lead to stupor, where an individual is almost entirely inactive, unable to care for basic needs.</p>
		<ul>
		    <li>Extreme slowing of movement and thought</li>
		    <li>Inability to perform basic self-care tasks (e.g., feeding)</li>
		</ul>

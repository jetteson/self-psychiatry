    <h1>Social Recovery</h1>
    <p>Optimal mental health is not a single-player game. Our connections with others can revitalize us, and in turn, we can offer strength and support to others. On the flip side, negative relationships can contribute to worsening mental health. While no relationship is without flaws, healthy relationships—despite their imperfections—can provide love, security, friendship, accountability, purpose, direction, and hope.</p>
